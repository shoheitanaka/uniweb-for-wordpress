A wide range of customization is possible without compromising your brand or worldview.
Rich accessibility features that support standards.

== Installation ==

= Automatic installation =

Automatic installation is the easiest option -- WordPress will handle the file transfer, and you won’t need to leave your web browser. To automatically install Uniweb for WP, log in to your WordPress dashboard, navigate to the Plugins menu, and click “Add New.”

In the search field, type “Uniweb for WP,” then click “Search Plugins.” Once you’ve found us, you can view its details, such as the point release, rating, and description. Most importantly, of course, you can install it! Click “Install Now,” and WordPress will take it from there.

= Manual installation =

Manual installation requires downloading the Uniweb for WP plugin and uploading it to your web server via your favorite FTP application. The WordPress codex contains [instructions on how to do this here](https://wordpress.org/support/article/managing-plugins/#manual-plugin-installation).

= Updating =

Automatic updates should work smoothly, but we recommend backing up your site.
